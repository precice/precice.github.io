The 4th preCICE Workshop will be held in-presence at the campus Garching of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), on February 13-16, 2023 (with optional social events on February 12). The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process.

We know that organizing a presence conference in the winter may turn out to be complicated. We will consider an online alternative depending on the situation and local policies in fall 2022. We have had nice experiences with the online [preCICE 2022](precice-workshop-2022.html) and [preCICE 2021](precice-workshop-2021.html), but we still aim for reproducing the atmosphere of [preCICE 2020](precice-workshop-2020.html).

More details to be announced in fall 2022.
