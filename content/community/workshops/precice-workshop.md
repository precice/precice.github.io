The preCICE Workshop is the place to be for everyone working on or simply interested to start with preCICE. We are meeting every year since 2020 to train new people, collect feedback, and work together, trying to make every year's event better than the previous one.
Read about our [experiences](https://doi.org/10.14279/eceasst.v85.2700) or about [organizing a preCICE Workshop](precice-workshop-organizing.html).

## More than a conference

Of course, there are talks. We typically have a single track of user and developer talks, focusing on news, novel applications, and methods. At the same time, we give everyone the chance to introduce their research via quick introduction talks or other means (posters, forum posts).

However, the workshop experience spans far beyond talks.

## Training

Come to the preCICE workshop to learn how to run your first coupled simulations via an extensive [training course](community-training.html). This training course gets expanded every year, so it remains useful for returning users as well.

## Shaping the future

We call it a workshop to emphasize the interactivity. And one of the ways to interact is by participating to the World Café, in which users and developers discuss the next directions for the project, including how bigger features should work, and how community contributions could be better coordinated.

## Working together

During the workshop, we reserve time to directly work with users on their applications.
This offer is open to all workshop participants and the concrete planning and matching
of users to experts happens during the workshop.
We typically help new users design their coupling projects, discuss feature requests, or resolve bugs together.

## Giving back to the community

The workshop is open to everyone, but we are aware that not everyone is able to attend.
At the same time, we also want to be able to refer to the content ourselves.
For this reason, we release talk recordings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/preCICECoupling), gradually after each workshop.

We also publish [training material developed together with the community](https://github.com/precice/community-training).
Note, however, that this cannot capture the hands-on collaborative experience that the workshop offers.

## Small investment, large benefit

We structure the workshop schedule in a way that you can attend selected parts of it,
especially if you are already an experienced user, or if you just want to see
what the latest updates and new applications are.

We offer discounts for academia and support the participation
of students and international researchers that would otherwise not be able to join.
The participation fee also supports maintaining preCICE in the long run.

In return, the whole preCICE team works together to make sure that we all
have the best possible experience and learning.

Don't just take our word for it, see what previous participants wrote:

> The task by task design of the course was nice to deeper understand how preCICE works.
> Talk with the developers about our applications and problems was very useful.
> **I come back to my lab with a lot of new ideas and solutions.**
> I would come again to follow the updates of preCICE,
> to find some solutions to the problem that I face and hopefully present my
> application coupling if the results and conclusions are interesting.

> Really enjoyed all the **networking opportunities.**

> I really like the **interaction with the other users** in the preCICE community.
> **It's a good place to get ideas and talk about your work.**
> I would come again to get to know the updates and get some hands-on user help.

## History

So far, we have aimed for annual workshops rotating between Munich and Stuttgart, the historical homes of preCICE.
In 2025, we are organizing our first workshop together with the community.
Let us know if you would like to host and help us organize one of the next workshops,
in particular if this makes sense in the context of a research funding proposal and/or an active local community.

aiming to reach out to a wider community that typically cannot travel to Europe.
