The GO-VIKING project was created to study flow-induced vibrations inside nuclear power plants more effectively. The VKI hosts a facility called GOKSTAD, where measurements are taken to compare with numerical results. The numerical results were obtained using LES simulations, with the aim of getting as close as possible to the experimental data and identifying correlations between the two.

In the experimental facility, a fully turbulent developed flow is generated before the inlet of the test section. To reproduce the same conditions in the numerical simulations, preCICE was used to couple a simple channel (providing the fully developed flow) to the inlet of the test section.
