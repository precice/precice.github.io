summary: "We are actively developing preCICE. These are some of the features you can expect in the future."
---

preCICE applies [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), introducing new functionality in minor and major releases. A minor release does not mean fewer changes than a major release, it only means that we add new functionality while keeping backwards compatibility. We release breaking changes only every few years, giving you time to focus on your project, keeping updates easy.

In this page, you can find information about features that we plan to introduce in next releases. This is not meant to be a strict schedule, but rather a hint on the directions that preCICE is heading towards. We also have a few [issue milestones](https://github.com/precice/precice/milestones), which are updated more often. Issues and work packages of bigger features are generally grouped in [projects](https://github.com/precice/precice/projects).

If you are looking for features introduced already in the past, have a look at our [Changelog](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).

## In active development

- [Dynamic coupling meshes](https://github.com/precice/precice/projects/2)
- [Waveform relaxation for multi-rate coupling and higher-order time stepping](https://github.com/precice/precice/projects/7)
- [Solver-based data mapping](couple-your-code-direct-access.html) to take advantage of higher-order shape functions
- [Cell-based linear interpolation for volumetric coupling](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/468)
- [Adaptive and flexible macro-micro coupling software](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager)
- [Improving](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/1252) the experimental [Nearest-neighbor gradient data mapping](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1169)
- [More robust and efficient quasi-Newton acceleration](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1152)
- Extendable and modular system tests

## On our list

- Geometric multi-scale data mapping, e.g. for 3D-1D and 3D-2D coupled problems
- Tutorial testcase on electromagnetics
- [Support multiple `SolverInterface` instances simultaneously](https://github.com/precice/precice/projects/8)
- [Non-mesh-related global data exchange](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/202)
- [Windows support](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/200)
- [Splitting coupling meshes into patches](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/374)
- [Two-level initialization enabled by default](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/633). This feature was introduced in preCICE v2.0, but is currently switched off by default as not all use cases are supported yet.
- Partition-of-Unity RBF data mapping for very large problems
- More tutorial testcases for and better support of fluid-fluid coupling, including backflow
- Tutorial testcases for CFD-DEM coupling
- In-memory communication for volume-coupled problems
- A [configuration generator](https://github.com/precice/controller)
