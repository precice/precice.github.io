The 4th preCICE Workshop will be held in-presence at the campus Garching of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), on February 13-16, 2023. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process.

Expect user and developer talks, hands-on training sessions, discussions with the developers on your applications and use cases, feedback rounds, and plenty of opportunities to network with the rest of our vibrant community.

## Call for contributions

You do not need to present anything to join this workshop. However, your contributions are very welcome! We are looking for talks that could be beneficial for the wider preCICE community. Are you developing a new adapter? Are you using preCICE for an exciting new application? Are you developing new methods that should not be missing from preCICE? Then open your editor and start sketching a short abstract (free text, < 1000 characters) for a 20min talk right now! 😉

We will accept contributions in two batches. **Submit your abstract till December 16**, and we will reply before Christmas. You can still submit later and till January 9, in which case, we will reply before January 16. There will be no further extensions.

[Submit your talk abstract](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/cloud/apps/forms/oS6C7tLp88t2EAHR).

## Program details

### User introductions

On the first day, we will have a round of introductions, so that everyone knows who to talk to during the workshop.
[Submit](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/cloud/s/G68eRdTTx5832CK) one PDF slide (16:9, with name `surname-firstname.pdf`) with your name and some key details/pictures about your research till February 9, as we need to prepare a single slideshow.

### World Café

A classic for a preCICE Workshop, the preCICE [World Café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_caf%C3%A9_(conversation)) is your opportunity to shape the future of preCICE.

### User support sessions

It's a workshop and not a classical conference, as we also get to do things together. Meet the experts to discuss your current or planned projects, as well as to debug any current issues.

On March 31, 10:00-15:00, we will have a post-workshop user-support session to catch up on any progress.

## Location

Having offered [preCICE 2022](precice-workshop-2022.html) and [preCICE 2021](precice-workshop-2021.html) online, we are now looking forward to meeting our community again in person, similarly to [preCICE 2020](precice-workshop-2020.html). With the current situation, we are confident that this will be possible.

The event itself will take place at the [LRZ](https://www.lrz.de/english/) building (Boltzmannstr. 1) and the social events will take place in the town of Garching.

We will soon reserve hotel rooms in Garching for you to book with some discount and publish a list of hotels here. Note that the campus is relatively far for the city center of Munich and you would need an M+2 ticket to reach the campus via public transport.

## Registration

We will open the registration soon. We will be offering discounts for early registrations and for participants from academia.
