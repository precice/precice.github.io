## What is the preCICE distribution?

preCICE is much more than the core library: it is a larger ecosystem that includes
language bindings, adapters for popular solvers, tutorials, and more. We know that it
can be difficult to figure out which versions to install, therefore we will be
publishing here lists of known-to-work versions.
