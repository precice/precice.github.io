## Publication of distribution on DaRUS

For every new (major) distribution release, we publish an archive of all included sources on [DaRUS](https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/). As an example, see the [v2104.0 data set](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-2125).

### Authorship

Authors of the data set are:

- All current [maintainers](./community-contributors.html#maintainers)
- Everybody who significantly contributed to the delta between the last and this major distribution release. Significant contributions need to go beyond *good first issues*. Actively maintaining a component or significant reviewing does also qualify as significant contribution.
- Supervisors who actively contributed ideas to the delta between the last and this major distribution release

Order of authors: maintainers are listed first followed by everybody else, both in alphabetical order.
