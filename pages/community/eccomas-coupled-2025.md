The [ECCOMAS Coupled Problems 2025](https://coupled2025.cimne.com/) will take place on Sardinia, Italy from May 26 to 29.

We are again organizing a preCICE minisymposium: [Multi-Physics and Multi-Scale Simulations with the Coupling Library preCICE](https://coupled2025.cimne.com/event/session/e430d14b-0b28-11f0-9835-000c29ddfc0c) ([abstract](https://coupled2025.cimne.com/event/area/3dec3ef1-70ff-11ef-bbc6-000c29ddfc0c)) (IS042).

Feel free to ask questions in the [corresponding thread of the forum](https://precice.discourse.group/t/call-for-contributions-eccomas-coupled-problems-2025/2197).

## Schedule of the Minisymposium
