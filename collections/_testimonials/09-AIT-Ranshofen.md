The continuous casting process combines various physical aspects. As the liquid metal is continuously fed into a mould, a mixture between liquid, mushy and solid phases emerges. FVM based CFD solvers (e.g. OpenFOAM, Ansys CFX) are capable of predicting the temperature household considering convective heat transfer. However, FEM based CSM solvers (e.g. LS-DYNA) are better suited for calculating the resulting stress and strain fields, in order to identify critical zones and predict failure. preCICE enables us, the Light Metals Technologies Ranshofen, to couple the CFD solver with the CSM solver so to combine their single advantages. Furthermore, the possibility exists to couple an additional solver for the virtual simulation of the microstructural behaviour during solidification.
