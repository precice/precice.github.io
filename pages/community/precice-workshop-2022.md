The 3rd preCICE Workshop will be held virtually through [SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), from February 21-24, 2022. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process.

[Registration](https://precice.org/precice-workshop-2022.html#registration) are now open. We look forward to welcoming back previous participants, and introducing more members to the preCICE community.

Due to the uncertain times we are experiencing with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the great success of the virtual workshop last year, we are planning to host the workshop virtually again.

If you have any questions regarding the workshop, please contact us at [`precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de`](mailto:precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de).

## Program

Coming soon.

## Registration

This is an academic, non-profit conference. However, we still have to collect a small registration fee.
For early registrations (until January 17), the registration fee is

* 50€ for members of universities and public research institutes and
* 150€ for all other participants.

Registration is still possible after this date, with a registration fee of

* 100€ for members of universities and public research institutes and
* 300€ for all other participants.

For those that do not have access to funding to pay for the registration, you can write an email to us at [`precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de`](mailto:precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de), and we will evaluate each case individually. For selected cases we will supply a voucher to be used when registering that voids the required payment.
