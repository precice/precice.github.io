## Why is support for preCICE necessary?

Unfortunately the majority of open source software is abandoned at some point, because the developers lack the resources to maintain and develop the software. Using open source software in a professional context can therefore be considered risky, because the long-term sustainability is uncertain.  In order to ensure a sustainable future for preCICE, we are taking steps  to make sure preCICE remains the leading, state-of-the-art coupling solution. By supporting preCICE as an academic or industry user, you contribute to the long-term development of preCICE and receive dedicated support from the preCICE development team.

## Funding and support options

There are three different ways to fund and support the development of preCICE.

### 1. Research project partner

Include preCICE as a project partner in your research project proposal or team up with the preCICE developers to write a proposal. This is the best option when you want to benefit from the research and scientific expertise of the preCICE team, and increase the chances that your project is funded. The developers of preCICE are experts in state-of-the-art numerical methods, high-performance computing, and software engineering for multi-X coupled problems. Reviewers appreciate the highly recognized expertise of preCICE, demonstrated by our fast growing [number of citations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&cites=5053469347483527186), and [vibrant community](community-projects.html).

Directly [contact Jun. Prof. Benjamin Uekermann](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/us3/) to discuss a collaboration.

### 2. Support license

A support license is the easiest way to support preCICE. By acquiring a support license, you directly contribute to the development of preCICE through a fixed amount per year. In exchange, you receive a number of benefits, in particular timely and direct support from the preCICE developers around any issues that may arise when using preCICE. We provide two service levels, with discounted rates for academia.

#### Direct cost in a research project

As an academic user you can declare the support license, like any software license, as a direct cost/consumable in your research proposal (see e.g. section 2.1 in [basic module DFG guidelines](https://www.dfg.de/formulare/52_01/52_01_en.pdf)). It is also recommended to include the support license as a risk mitigation strategy to highlight that you, as a project lead, have the support for a successful implementation. In addition, as part of the support license, you can leverage the preCICE website and community for your communication/dissemination activities.

### 3. (Sub-) contracting

Contracting is another option to benefit from the expertise of the preCICE developers. As an academic user, this would typically be as a sub-contractor for a specific work package or task in your research project, e.g. active support in the development of a new adapter.

Please note that we can only offer a very limited amount of contracting and we strongly advise you to include preCICE as a project partner, or acquire a support license instead.
