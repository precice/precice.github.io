## {{ Simulation of flow-acoustic-structural interactions in duct systems }}
<div class="row" markdown="1">
<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">
{{ To study the influence of flow-induced vibrations on noise mitigation solutions in duct systems like ventilation systems, the interactions between the flow-acoustic field inside the duct and the structural vibrations of the flexible components need to be understood. Therefore I coupled an in-house MPI-parallelized aeroacoustics solver for the linearized Euler equations to an in-house structural solver for linear elasto-dynamics. The coupling is managed by the preCICE library, which offers an excellent framework for coupling time domain solvers. }}
