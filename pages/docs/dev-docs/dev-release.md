We keep a detailed step, by step guide of the release-process in our repository:

* [Release](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/releasing/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release_pull_request_template.md)
* [Hotfix](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/releasing/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/hotfix_pull_request_template.md)

You may also have a look at our [release strategy](./dev-docs-release-strategy.html).
