In our research group, coupled simulations of thin flat wings and flexible structures in high-speed flows such as transonic and supersonic flows is conducted. Our fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis model is constructed based on the coupling between the compressible fluid solver SU2 and the structure solver CalculiX using preCICE. The unsteady behavior of the self-induced oscillation of a flat delta wing in a transonic flow is investigated with the FSI model. The oscillation of a flat delta wing starts with an initial disturbance and eventually leads to a large limit-cycle oscillation. The mechanism of coupling between elastic deformation and transonic flow near the wing which causes the limit-cycle oscillation is clarified by the FSI model.
