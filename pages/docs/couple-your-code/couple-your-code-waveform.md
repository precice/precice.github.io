These API functions are work in progress, experimental, and are not yet released. The API might change during the ongoing development process. Use with care.
{% endexperimental %}
{% note %}
This feature is only available for parallel implicit coupling. An extension to serial implicit coupling is planned. Without loss of generality, we moreover only discuss the API functions `readBlockVectorData` and `writeBlockVectorData` in the examples.

preCICE allows the participants to use subcycling – meaning: to work with individual timestep sizes smaller than the time window size. Note that participants always have to synchronize at the end of each *time window*. If you are not sure about the difference between a time window and a timestep or you want to know how subcycling works in detail, see ["Step 5 - Non-matching timestep sizes" of the step-by-step guide](couple-your-code-timestep-sizes.html). In the following section, we take a closer look at the exchange of coupling data when subcycling and advanced techniques for interpolation of coupling data inside of a time window.

## Exchange of coupling data with subcycling

preCICE only exchanges data at the end of the last timestep in each time window – the end of the time window. By default, preCICE only exchanges data that was written at the very end of the time window. This approach automatically leads to discontinuities or "jumps" when going from one time window to the next. Coupling data has a constant value (in time) within one coupling window. This leads to lower accuracy of the overall simulation.[^1]

### Example for subcycling without waveform iteration

The figure below visualizes this situation for a single coupling window ranging from $$t_\text{ini}$$ to $$t_\text{ini}+\Delta t$$:

![Coupling data exchange without interpolation](images/docs/couple-your-code/couple-your-code-waveform/WaveformConstant.png)

The two participants Dirichlet $$\mathcal{D}$$ and Neumann $$\mathcal{N}$$ use their respective timestep sizes $$\delta t$$ and produce coupling data $$c$$ at the end of each timestep. But only the very last samples $$c_{\mathcal{N}\text{end}}$$ and $$c_{\mathcal{D}\text{end}}$$ are exchanged. If the Dirichlet participant $$\mathcal{D}$$ calls `readBlockVectorData`, it always reads the same value $$c_{\mathcal{N}\text{end}}$$ from preCICE, independent from the current timestep.

## Linear interpolation in a time window

A simple solution to reach higher accuracy is to apply linear interpolation inside of a time window to get smoother coupling boundary conditions. With this approach time-dependent functions (so-called *waveforms*) are exchanged between the participants. Since these waveforms are exchanged iteratively in implicit coupling, we call this procedure *waveform iteration*. Exchanging waveforms leads to a more robust subcycling and allows us to support higher order time stepping.[^1]

### Example for waveform iteration with linear interpolation

Linear interpolation between coupling boundary conditions of the previous and the current time window is illustrated below:

![Coupling data exchange with linear interpolation](images/docs/couple-your-code/couple-your-code-waveform/WaveformLinear.png)

If the Dirichlet participant $$\mathcal{D}$$ calls `readBlockVectorData`, it samples the data from a time-dependent function $$c_\mathcal{D}(t)$$. This function is created from linear interpolation of the first and the last sample $$c_{\mathcal{D}0}$$ and $$c_{\mathcal{D}5}$$ created by the Neumann participant $$\mathcal{N}$$ in the current time window. This allows $$\mathcal{D}$$ to sample the coupling condition at arbitrary times $$t$$ inside the current time window.

## Experimental API for waveform iteration

If we want to improve the accuracy by using waveforms, this requires an extension of the existing API, because we need a way to tell preCICE where we want to sample the waveform. For this purpose, preCICE offers an experimental API. Here, `readBlockVectorData` accepts an additional argument `relativeReadTime`. This allows us to choose the time where the waveform should be sampled:

```cpp
// stable API with constant data in time window
void readBlockVectorData(int dataID, int size, const int* valueIndices, double* values) const;

// experimental API for waveform iteration
void readBlockVectorData(int dataID, int size, const int* valueIndices, double relativeReadTime, double* values) const;
```

`relativeReadTime` describes the time relatively to the beginning of the current timestep. This means that `relativeReadTime = 0` gives us access to data at the beginning of the timestep. By choosing `relativeReadTime > 0` we can sample data at later points. The maximum allowed `relativeReadTime` corresponds to the remaining time until the end of the current time window. Remember that the remaining time until the end of the time window is always returned when calling `precice_dt = precice.advance(dt)` as `precice_dt`. So `relativeReadTime = precice_dt` corresponds to sampling data at the end of the current time window.

If we choose to use a smaller timestep size `dt < precice_dt`, we apply subcycling and therefore `relativeReadTime = dt` corresponds to sampling data at the end of the timestep. But we can also use smaller values for `relativeReadTime`, as shown in the usage example below. When using subcycling, it is important to note that `relativeReadTime = precice_dt` is the default behavior, if no `relativeReadTime` is provided, because preCICE cannot know the `dt` our solver wants to use. This also means that if subcycling is applied one must use the experimental API and provide `relativeReadTime` to benefit from the higher accuracy waveforms.

The experimental API has to be activated in the configuration file via the `experimental` attribute. This allows us to define the order of the interpolant in the `read-data` tag of the corresponding `participant`. Currently, we support two interpolation schemes: constant and linear interpolation. The interpolant is always constructed using data from the beginning and the end of the window. The default is constant interpolation (`waveform-order="0"`). The following example uses `waveform-order="1"` and, therefore, linear interpolation:

```xml
<solver-interface experimental="true" ... >
...
    <participant name="FluidSolver">
        <use-mesh name="FluidMesh" provide="yes"/>
        <write-data name="Forces" mesh="MyMesh"/>
        <read-data name="Displacements" mesh="FluidMesh" waveform-order="1"/>
    </participant>
...
</solver-interface>
```

## Usage example

We are now ready to extend the example from ["Step 6 - Implicit coupling"](couple-your-code-implicit-coupling.html) to use waveforms. Let us assume that our fluid solver uses a midpoint rule as time stepping method. In this case, only few changes are necessary to sample the `Displacements` at the middle of the time window:

```cpp
...
precice_dt = precice.initialize();
while (not simulationDone()){ // time loop
  // write checkpoint
  ...
  dt = beginTimestep(); // e.g. compute adaptive dt
  dt = min(precice_dt, dt);
  if (precice.isReadDataAvailable()){ // if waveform order >= 1 always true, because we can sample at arbitrary points
    // sampling in the middle of the timestep
    precice.readBlockVectorData(displID, vertexSize, vertexIDs, 0.5 * dt, displacements);
    setDisplacements(displacements); // displacement at the middle of the timestep
  }
  solveTimeStep(dt); // might be using midpoint rule for time-stepping
  if (precice.isWriteDataRequired(dt)){ // only true at the end of the time window
    computeForces(forces);
    precice.writeBlockVectorData(forceID, vertexSize, vertexIDs, forces);
  }
  precice_dt = precice.advance(dt);
  // read checkpoint & end timestep
  ...
}
...
```
