summary: "How to build the adapted CalculiX `ccx_preCICE`"
---

After [installing preCICE](installation-overview.html) and [getting the CalculiX source and the required dependencies](adapter-calculix-get-calculix.html), you can now build the adapter, i.e. a modified CCX executable.

## Building the adapted CalculiX

1. Download and unzip the adapter (e.g. in the `CaluliX` folder):

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/precice/calculix-adapter/archive/master.zip 
    unzip master.zip 
    cd calculix-adapter-master
    ```

2. Edit the `Makefile` to set the paths to dependencies.
   - If you have the CalculiX source in `~/CalculiX/` and the dependencies in your global paths, you don't need to change anything.
   - Otherwise, set `CCX` and, if built from source, the include and lib flags for SPOOLES, ARPACK, and yaml-cpp.
3. Clean any previous builds with `make clean`.
4. Build with `make` (e.g. `make -j 4` for parallel).
5. You should now have a new executable `ccx_preCICE` in the `bin/` folder of the adapter. You may move this file to a path known by your system, or [add this to your `PATH`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059/36693) (careful when doing this!).

### Building the adapter with PaStiX

Since version 2.17 of CalculiX, it is possible to link the PaStiX solver for increased performance, mostly through GPUs. Building the adapter with PaStix is quite tedious, as most dependencies of PaStiX and PaStiX itslef must be built from source. To help you go thorugh this, we provide [detailed instructions on a dedicated page](adapter-calculix-pastix-build.html).

### Makefile options

The adapter is built using GNU Make. The `Makefile` contains a few variables on top, which need to be adapted to your system:

 1. `CCX`: Location of the original CalculiX solver (CCX) source code ("src" directory)
    - Example: `$(HOME)/CalculiX/ccx_2.16/src`
 2. `SPOOLES_INCLUDE`: Include flags for SPOOLES
    - Example 1: `SPOOLES_INCLUDE   = -I/usr/include/spooles/` (installed)
    - Example 2: `SPOOLES_INCLUDE   = -I$(HOME)/SPOOLES.2.2/` (source)
 3. `SPOOLES_LIBS`: Library flags for SPOOLES
    - Example 1: `SPOOLES_LIBS      = -lspooles` (installed)
    - Example 2: `SPOOLES_LIBS      = $(HOME)/SPOOLES.2.2/spooles.a` (source)
 4. `ARPACK_INCLUDE`: Include flags for ARPACK
    - Example 1: `ARPACK_INCLUDE    =` (installed, nothing needed)
    - Example 2: `ARPACK_INCLUDE    = -I$(HOME)/ARPACK` (source)
 5. `ARPACK_LIBS`: Library flags for ARPACK
    - Example 1: `ARPACK_LIBS       = -larpack -llapack -lblas` (installed)
    - Example 2: `ARPACK_LIBS       = $(HOME)/ARPACK/libarpack_INTEL.a` (source)
 6. `YAML_INCLUDE`: Include flags for yaml-cpp
    - Example 1: `YAML_INCLUDE      = -I/usr/include/` (installed)
    - Example 2: `YAML_INCLUDE      = -I$(HOME)/yaml-cpp/include` (source)
 7. `YAML_LIBS`: Library flags for yaml-cpp
    - Example 1: `YAML_LIBS         = -lyaml-cpp` (installed)
    - Example 2: `YAML_LIBS         = -L$(HOME)/yaml-cpp/build -lyaml-cpp` (source)

You may also want to adjust the compiler `FC` from `mpifort` to `mpif90` or to any other compiler your system uses.

### Compiling with GCC 10 or newer

If you compile with GCC 10 or newer, you will get the following error, originating from CalculiX:

```text
Error: Rank mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument at (2) (rank-1 and scalar)
```

To work around this, you need to add `-fallow-argument-mismatch` to the `FFLAGS` inside `Makefile`:

```diff
- FFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -fopenmp $(INCLUDES)
+ FFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -fopenmp -fallow-argument-mismatch $(INCLUDES)
```

### Notes on preCICE versions

<details markdown="1"><summary>In case you are using some very old preCICE version, please upgrade. Our <a href="https://precice.discourse.group/" title="preCICE forum">community</a> is happy to help you. Click here and keep reading if you loved preCICE v1.x and (optionally) wish The Beatles were still around.</summary>

1. This adapter expects the preCICE C bindings in `[prefix]/include/precice/SolverInterfaceC.h` and gets this path from pkg-config. In other words, this assumes that preCICE (at least v1.4.0) has been built & installed with CMake (e.g. using a Debian package). In case you want to keep using preCICE built with SCons, see the changes invoked by [Pull Request #14](https://github.com/precice/calculix-adapter/pull/14).
2. Starting from preCICE v1.2.0, the name (and the respective paths) of the language "adapters" have changed to language "bindings". This affects the line `#include "precice/bindings/c/SolverInterfaceC.h"` in `calculix-adapter/adapter/PreciceInterface.c`. To compile with older preCICE versions, change `bindings` to `adapters`.
