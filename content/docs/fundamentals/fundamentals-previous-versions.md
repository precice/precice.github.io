In regular intervals, we archive PDF exports of this documentation. Refer to those when you are looking for information regarding previous versions:

- For preCICE v2.x: [libprecice2_2.2.5_docs_v202211.0.0.pdf](https://github.com/precice/precice.github.io/releases/download/v202211.0.0/libprecice2_2.2.5_docs_v202211.0.0.pdf)
- Before preCICE v2.x, the documentation was hosted in a [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Home/f6bfac33aa878ab3e89e60720894e4fe0a547ab4). For each page you want to visit, look at the previous revisions.

We only support the latest version of preCICE, but upgrading is easy: See our [porting guides](./couple-your-code-porting-overview.html).

The PDF exports of the documentation are part of the [preCICE Distribution](./installation-distribution.html). Alternatively, you can build [previous states of this website](https://github.com/precice/precice.github.io).
