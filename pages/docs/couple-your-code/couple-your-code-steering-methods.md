summary: "In this step, you get to know the most important API functions of preCICE: initialize, advance, and finalize."

As a first preparation step, you need to include the preCICE library headers. In C++, you need to include the file [precice.hpp](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/src/precice/precice.hpp).
The handle to the preCICE API is the class `precice::Participant`. Its constructor requires the participant's name, the preCICE configuration file's name and the `rank` and `size` of the current thread. Once the basic preCICE interface is set up, we can _steer_ the behaviour of preCICE. For that we need the following functions:

```cpp
Participant( String participantName, String configurationFileName, int rank, int size );
void initialize();
void advance ( double computedTimeStepSize );
void finalize();
```

What do they do?

* `initialize` establishes communication channels and sets up data structures of preCICE.
* `advance` needs to be called after the computation of every time step to _advance_ the coupling. As an argument, you have to pass the solver's last _time step_ size (`dt`). Additionally, it maps coupling data between the coupling meshes, it communicates coupling data between the coupled participants, and it accelerates coupling data. One could say the complete coupling happens within this single function.
* `finalize` frees the preCICE data structures and closes communication channels.

Synchronization of the participants etc. happens at the end of a _time window_. A time window consists of one or multiple time steps of size `dt` or $\delta t$ performed by the participants. Consequently, the participants must always use a time step size smaller than the time window size, i.e. $\delta t \leq \Delta t$. The following function allows us to query the maximum allowed time step size from preCICE such that a participant does not move beyond the synchronization point:

```cpp
double getMaxTimeStepSize();
```

With this mechanism we can either use a time step size equal to the time window size resulting in synchronization of the participants after every single time step or we can perform multiple time steps before we synchronize. We refer to the latter as _subcycling_ and will discuss this feature in more detail in [Step 5](couple-your-code-time-step-sizes.html).

Using the API methods introduced above we can now extend the code of our fluid solver:

```cpp
#include <precice/precice.hpp>

turnOnSolver(); //e.g. setup and partition mesh

precice::Participant precice("FluidSolver","precice-config.xml",rank,size); // constructor

double solverDt; // solver time step size
double preciceDt; // maximum precice time step size
double dt; // actual time step size

precice.initialize();
while (not simulationDone()){ // time loop
  preciceDt = getMaxTimeStepSize();
  solverDt = beginTimeStep(); // e.g. compute adaptive dt
  dt = min(preciceDt, solverDt); // determine actual dt
  solveTimeStep(dt);
  precice.advance(dt);
  endTimeStep(); // e.g. update variables, increment time
}
precice.finalize(); // frees data structures and closes communication channels
turnOffSolver();
```
