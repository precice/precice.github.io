    <p>solids4foam is an open-source OpenFOAM toolbox for solid mechanics and fluid-solid interactions (<a href="https://solids4foam.github.io/">solids4foam.github.io</a>). With recent updates to the preCICE OpenFOAM adapter, solids4foam can now act as the solid solver in fluid-solid interaction simulations driven by preCICE. This talk overviews the solids4foam toolbox, including the adopted class-based solid and fluid model approach. The finite volume method for solid mechanics will be briefly summarised, followed by the structure of a typical solids4foam case. The second half of the talk will adopt a hands-on approach to introduce how to combine solids4foam with preCICE. Following a brief overview of how to install solids4foam, examples of fluid-solid interaction cases will be presented, such as a beam in cross flow and a pressure wave in a pipe. The talk will conclude with a look to future directions.</p>

    <p>Multiscale simulation scenarios often consist of coupling between problems at different scales. In such scenarios, researchers mostly focus on developing coupling methodology for their application, but largely ignore software engineering and software reusability aspects. This can lead to reinventing technicalities of the coupling again and again. This talk presents a flexible and application-agnostic software framework to couple simulation codes at different scales. The new lightweight software is called Micro Manager, and it allows for reusing the coupling library preCICE for two-scale coupled problems. We discuss various features of the Micro Manager which make it a flexible tool for multiscale coupling.</p>

    <p>Solving large-scale data mapping problems on scattered data comes with the usual accuracy-performance trade-off: Projection-based methods such as nearest-neighbor methods are computationally cheap, but deliver only first-order accuracy. Kernel-methods based on radial-basis functions can provide higher-order, but are exceedingly expensive in terms of computational cost. This talk presents recent advances, which either improve the accuracy of our projection-based methods or mitigate the computational cost of our kernel-based methods. The talk focuses particularly on relevant features coming in the new preCICE version 3 and demonstrates user-visible advantages using realistic showcases. </p>

      Modelling an agonist-antagonist muscle pair with OpenDiHu and preCICE<br/>

    <p>Skeletal muscles are typically paired together in an agonist-antagonist (AA) muscle pair. The aim of this project is to model the novel agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) amputation technique, where AA muscles are mechanically connected by a tendon. Since muscles are an active hierarchical tissue, a multi-scale multi-physics problem is solved just to simulate a single muscle. The software of choice is OpenDiHu, which is able to perform scalable biophysical neuromuscular simulations. To model the AMI amputation, we use preCICE to couple two muscle solvers to a tendon solver. On the one hand, we couple the muscle‚Äôs top level, numerically represented by a solid mechanics mesh, to the tendon. On the other hand, we must implement the direct crossed-feedback loop between the sensory organs and the motor neurons of the AA muscle pair. All in all, this results in a complicated multi-coupling case with at least three participants.</p>

      A preCICE-interface for the ice-sheet and sea-level system model<br/>

    <p>Earth system modeling requires expertise of multiple scientific domains, including, for example, geographers, oceanologists and glaciologists. The Ice-sheet and Sea-level system model (ISSM) is a MPI parallel multiphysics finite element framework to simulate large ice-sheets like Greenland and Antarctica. Previous performance studies have validated the good scaling properties of this code.
    In climate simulations, ISSM depends on external input data, e.g. subglacial hydrology models. Currently, this data is precalculated and handed to ISSM as a static file input. However, as the subglacial hydrology is affected by ice sheet evolution as well, bidirectional high frequent data exchange is beneficial for the entire accuracy. To enable dynamic data exchange during run-time, we develop the first ever exchange interface for ISSM using preCICE.
    We present the coupling of ISSM and CUAS-MPI, a subglacial hydrology model, and discuss the challenges of integrating preCICE in a complex framework like ISSM regarding time stepping and data accessibility. We note that the new possibilities of coupled execution then also create new challenges in modeling, e.g. geometry evolution.</p>

      Coupling an ice sheet model with satellite image based simulation of calving fronts<br/>

    </summary>
    <p>ISSM (Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model) is a software to simulate the evolution of glaciers and ice sheets. One of its important features is evolving the front of the glacier, which changes position due to melting, calving, and the forward movement of the glacier itself. Specifically, physics based models of calving are not yet able to capture the real behavior of the system precisely. We want to develop a data driven approach, computing the speed of the front from known positions that have been extracted from satellite images. This code will be coupled with ISSM using preCICE. The project is in its early stages. After a short introduction to ISSM, we will present the numerical methods we will use to compute the frontal speed. The front can be modeled using a level-set equation. Inversion of this model delivers the speed of the front. We will discuss the issues we expect to encounter in coupling the code to ISSM, like adaptive meshes, load balancing, integration of preCICE into ISSM, and stability of the coupled solution. The physics based approaches to calving are deeply integrated into ISSM. We hope to present some preliminary results of stability experiments where ISSM and the moving front module are less tightly coupled.</p>

      Investigation of OpenFOAM-XDEM momentum coupling results for AWJC Nozzle using preCICE<br/>

    <p>The high-speed water jet is the momentum source in an Abrasive Water Jet Cutting Nozzle. This momentum is transferred to the abrasive particles & the air within the nozzle. This leads to turbulent & complex particle-laden flow in the nozzle. These flow conditions can influence particle impacts on the nozzle, thus influencing erosion. Hence it is imperative that this complex particle-laden flow is captured correctly.
    The momentum exchange can be directly from the water jet to the particles or indirectly through the airflow. In this work, we investigate these fluid-particle momentum exchanges.
    Our prototype uses preCICE for volumetric coupling of XDEM (for the particle motion), & OpenFOAM (for the fluid). XDEM uses fluid flow conditions to compute the forces acting on particles. XDEM computes the particle momentum source that is injected into the fluid solver. The results of the coupled simulation align with literature & can be extended to include the FEM component for erosion predictions.</p>

    <p>Black-box coupling schemes often only reach first order when it comes to time stepping. Most coupling schemes do not allow the coupled solvers to run at independent time scales (multirate). In this talk, I will explain how we use B-Splines to construct a higher-order interpolating function for each coupling time window in preCICE. This approach allows multirate and higher-order time stepping for coupled black-box solvers. Additionally, I introduce the API, demonstrate possible use cases, and investigate the performance of this new feature through the example of a simple oscillator test case.</p>

      Partitioned flow simulations with preCICE and OpenFOAM<br/>

    <p>Large and heterogeneous flow simulations could benefit from partitioning, where each subdomain is solved by an individual, dedicated solver. In this presentation we will investigate and validate the fluid-fluid module of the preCICE OpenFOAM adapter by coupling two incompressible OpenFOAM fluid solvers via a surface Dirichlet-Neumann coupling approach. The results of various simple test cases are compared to monolithic OpenFOAM simulations. By utilizing a special pressure boundary condition, the coupled results show only a small error around the coupling interface. The magnitude of this error is dependent on the velocity gradient, the discretization size as well as the cell orthogonality. Looking into the OpenFOAM source code reveals that higher accuracy is only possible by manipulating the solvers themselves and thereby violating the black-box approach of preCICE.
  Additionally, the fluid-fluid module is extended to couple temperature with great accuracy for one validation case. Lastly, custom inlet-outlet boundary conditions are implemented for pressure and velocity, which switch their behavior dynamically depending on the flow direction. The results shown in this presentation provide a basis for future fluid-fluid coupling applications with preCICE.</p>

    <p>Our presentation concerns the simulation and validation of the hydroelastic performance of marine components.
    Our simulations involve three software components: the Multibody Dynamics solver MBDyn, the CFD solver OpenFOAM, and preCICE.
    MBDyn allows to model elements like rigid bodies or slender structures by means of a variety of elements; besides, it is equipped with a structure that maps a cloud of interface points and the multibody model, used to exchange the mutual kinematics and dynamics.
    The coupling described above has been successfully tested in different scenarios, including some well-known FSI problems, such as the Turek-Hron FSI benchmarks.
    In the presentation, we analyze the performance of our setup with marine components of different complexity, from a simple foil to a complete kitesurf keel made of composite material. This cases show the potentialities of our methodology: the ability to describe a complex structure by means of equivalent beams, the determination of the performance and the recovery of the stresses in the structure.</p>

    <p>OpenAI Gym API is a de facto standard API to communicate between reinforcement learning algorithms and simulation environments. The new software Gym-OpenFOAM is a Python environment fully compliant with the OpenAI Gym API to facilitate developing and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for fluid dynamics applications. In a reinforcement learning-interaction cycle, Gym-OpenFOAM takes advantage of coupling tool preCICE, an open-source library for multi-physics coupling, to handle information exchange between agent (decision maker) and OpenFOAM (simulation environment), an open-source library for computational fluid dynamics. This coupling approach results in a seamless non-invasive integration of a realistic simulation system with the reinforcement learning paradigm, enabling the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to the continuum mechanics field.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of demonstration, we use Gym-OpenFOAM framework to apply two state-of-the-art reinforcement algorithms, namely proximal policy optimisation (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC), for drag attenuation in flow over a cylinder.</p>

      preCICE-FMI Runner to couple controller models to PDEs<br/>
      <p>Leonard Willeke (<a href="https://github.com/LeonardWilleke">@LeonardWilleke</a>), University of Stuttgart, Germany</p>
    </summary>
    <p>The FMI standard is today‚Äôs most popular co-simulation concept. It enables interoperability of simulation models and software by treating simulation models as libraries (FMUs). A "coupler" then calls and orchestrates these models. This is easily possible for simple models, such as ODE-based ones, but difficult for PDE-based models. This presentation explores if and how FMU libraries can be coupled with other simulation tools via the coupling library preCICE. To this end, a runner software "preCICE-FMI" is being developed. It connects the FMU model via preCICE with potentially arbitrary many simulation partners. As a first step towards a general Runner, this project aims to couple an FMU model implementing a PID controller with simulations in OpenFOAM. A first example case of a coupling of FMU models with preCICE is shown. </p>
