Creating your own simulation or doing a rigorous performance study of a method?
There are probably a few common tasks that could use some automation for.

Here you will find a few tools to:

- [Visualize the preCICE configuration file](tooling-config-visualization.html) to understand if you are really asking preCICE to do what you meant to.
- [Analyze the performance of the coupled simulation](tooling-performance-analysis.html) to understand where the runtime comes from.
- [Compute parameters for the RBF mapping configuration](tooling-rbf-shape.html) to optimize the accuracy and performance of your RBF mapping.
