The 5th preCICE Workshop will be held at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), together with [SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/), on September 24-27, 2024. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process. Like always, we plan to have user and developer talks, hands-on training sessions, discussions with the developers about your applications and use cases, and plenty of opportunities for networking. Besides, this year we will organize a preCICE poster session for the first time!

The workshop will start with a hands-on training course on September 24-25. The [course](https://precice.org/community-training.html) is suited for both beginners and current preCICE users, since advanced topics will also be covered. The main part of the workshop will take place on September 25-27. A detailed program for the workshop will be available soon.

Keep watching this space for updates on registration, the workshop program, and more.

### Call for contributions

You do not need to submit a contribution to join this workshop. However, your contributions are very welcome! We are looking for talks and posters that could be beneficial for the wider preCICE community. Are you developing a new adapter? Are you using preCICE for an exciting new application? Are you developing new methods that should not be missing from preCICE? If the answer to any of these questions was yes, we encourage you to submit a brief abstract for a 20 minutes talk.

Are you revisiting one of the classical preCICE use cases? Did you already presented your work in a previous workshop? Then we would be very happy to catch up with your work and we encourage you to present a poster.
