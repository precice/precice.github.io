Inspired by aquatic animals’ flexible body and fins, a range of adaptive, flexible materials  have attracted attention in Wave Energy Converter (WEC) development in the past decade.
The specific characteristic of such material is that its shape deforms adapting to the loading applied to it. 
There are several benefits using a flexible material as part of WEC structures. 
In our project “[Bionic Adaptive Stretchable Materials for WEC (BASM-WEC)](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V040553/1)” (EP/V040553/1), we aim to develop an analysis and laboratory testing integrity toolbox to reliably design, analyse, and process the state of the art adaptive stretchable materials and structures applicable to WECs. 
To achieve the main objectives, a hydro-elastic analysis tool based on OpenFOAM, CalculiX and preCICE is developed to provide a robust analysis method for prescribing the detailed materials specification required by the desired WEC functionalities. 
Using this tool, fluid-structure interaction simulations are performed to study the performance of different flexible WECs, including flexible Oscillating Water Column (OWC) WEC and Anaconda WEC.
