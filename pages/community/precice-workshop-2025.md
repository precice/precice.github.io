The 6th preCICE Workshop will be held at the [Helmut-Schmidt University of Hamburg](https://www.hsu-hh.de/) on September 9-12, 2025. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process. Like always, we plan to have user and developer talks, hands-on training sessions, discussions with the developers about your applications and use cases, and plenty of opportunities for networking.

The workshop will include a hands-on training course. The [course](community-training.html) is suited for both beginners and current preCICE users, since advanced topics will also be covered.

Keep watching this space for updates on registration, the workshop program, and more.
