The 5th preCICE Workshop will be held at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), together with [SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/), on September 24-27, 2024. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process. Like always, we plan to have user and developer talks, hands-on training sessions, discussions with the developers about your applications and use cases, and plenty of opportunities for networking. Besides, this year we will organize a preCICE poster session for the first time!

The workshop will start with a hands-on training course on September 24-25. The [course](https://precice.org/community-training.html) is suited for both beginners and current preCICE users, since advanced topics will also be covered. The main part of the workshop will take place on September 25-27.

Keep watching this space for updates on registration, the workshop program, and more.

      Tackling the complexity of Greenland‚Äôs Ice Sheet with coupled models<br/>

    <p>Ice sheets are losing mass at unprecedented rates during the observational period, which has a large impact on society. Simulating their future evolution is, therefore, an urgent task. While ice sheets are basically gravity-driven lubricated flow, processes such as the calving of icebergs at the seaward margins, crack formation and meltwater retention are making it a complex system. The rapid changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet require modelling concepts in which large-scale ice sheet models are coupled with process models, such as calving and hydrology. Glaciated areas themselves are a compartment of the Earth system, and hence, Earth System Models demand ice sheet codes. This comes with requirements on ice sheet models, particularly concerning performance and coupling. In this presentation, the general multi-physics problem of ice sheet modelling is introduced, and a typical simulation framework includes procedures for deriving initial states, performance, and bottlenecks. We will discuss process models and how they relate to large-scale ice sheet codes. Finally, we will focus on the requirements of Earth system model couplers and how preCICE would advance current coupling frameworks of climate models.</p>

      Standardization of Adapters and Application Cases: The preECO Project<br/>

    <p>Through DFG's recent research software call, the preCICE maintainers acquired funding to increase the quality and reusability of all components in the preCICE ecosystem: the preECO project. For the next three years, we want to define and implement standardization guidelines together with you ‚Äì the preCICE community. These guidelines should cover adapter development and application cases. This could include high-impact requirements such as that adapters need to have an independent configuration file adhering to a defined schema and format. But also little details, such as that every application case needs to name the preCICE configuration file exactly `precice-config.xml`.The main idea is to establish a review process, where users can apply for quality stamps for their adapters or application cases. What is in this for you? You will get reviews for your adapters and application cases. You will know that they not only work, but that they are good and correct. You also get access to more adapters and everything will be easier to exchange. And you potentially get access to more exciting simulation setups than the tutorial cases. In this talk, we want to introduce the preECO project and explain its ideas, timeline, and scope. We then want to present first tentative guidelines for adapters and application cases as a starting point for discussion.</p>

## Call for contributions

<details>
  <summary>The call for contributions is closed.</summary>
  You do not need to submit a contribution to join this workshop. However, your contributions are very welcome! We are looking for talks and posters that could be beneficial for the wider preCICE community. Are you developing a new adapter? Are you using preCICE for an exciting new application? Are you developing new methods that should not be missing from preCICE? If the answer to any of these questions was yes, we encourage you to submit a brief abstract for a 20 minutes talk.

  Are you revisiting one of the classical preCICE use cases? Did you already present your work in a previous workshop? Then we would be very happy to catch up with your work and we encourage you to present a poster.
