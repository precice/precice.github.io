The [ECCOMAS Congress 2022](http://www.eccomas2022.org/frontal/default.asp) is scheduled for June 5-9, 2022, and will take place in Oslo, Norway. Similar to previous ECCOMAS conferences, we are again organizing a minisymposium [Multi-physics simulations with the coupling library preCICE](http://www.eccomas2022.org/admin/Files/FileAbstract/MS46.pdf).

## Call for contributions

Please submit contributions to our minisymposium through the [conference website](http://www.eccomas2022.org/frontal/default.asp).
We are open for any research developing or using preCICE, particularly research that is of interest to more people in the preCICE community. We are also open for work-in-progress talks.

Current **deadline for one-page abstracts is December 10, 2021**. Submission of conference papers is optional and typically due in Spring. Please always mention our minisymposium code MS46.

## Further talks about preCICE

Large conferences like this are an ideal opportunity to discuss with other groups and change our perspective. For this reason, we often participate with talks in different sessions.

Stay tuned for more details.
