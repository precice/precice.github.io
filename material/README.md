Here you may find a few graphics files that you can use when writing about preCICE. **If you need any other graphics, just ask!**

* `coupled`: Figures for coupling two or more solvers, where the distinction to "solver", "adapter", and "preCICE library" is shown.
You may easily modify these files to your needs with Inkscape or LibreOffice Draw.
* `flyers`: Advertising flyers / small posters that you would make us very happy if you printed and gave to your friends or sticked on your wall.
* `logo`: The preCICE logo.
* `overview`: An overview image of preCICE.
