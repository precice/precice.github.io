This section lists the various language bindings of preCICE and describes how to fetch and install them.

## Fortran bindings

These languages are natively supported by preCICE and are part of library binaries you already have.
For more details please read [linking to preCICE](installation-linking.html).

## Fortran module

In case you prefer to use the fortran module system, we also provide a [fortran module](https://github.com/precice/fortran-module).
While this is the more comfortable way to use preCICE in modern fortran code, you do need to first build this module and link it to your code.
See the bundled example for details.
