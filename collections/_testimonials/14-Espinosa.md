As a Master's thesis project at TUM, we used preCICE for coupling the 3D Navier-Stokes model and the 2D Shallow Water Equations model, using the OpenFOAM framework for the Navier-Stokes model and a stand-alone Shallow Water Equations solver written in C++. Such a coupling is interesting e.g. in flood simulations or simulation of sea waves near structures. The black-box coupling approach of preCICE made such a geometric multiscale coupling easier without any changes on the OpenFOAM side. [Learn more](http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1577072)
