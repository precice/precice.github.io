title: The CalculiX adapter
permalink: adapter-calculix-overview.html
keywords: adapter, calculix
summary: "The CalculiX adapter can be used to couple CalculiX to CFD solvers for FSI or CHT application or even to couple CalculiX to itself."

## Start here

1. [Get CalculiX and the dependencies](adapter-calculix-get-calculix.html)
2. [Build the Adapter](adapter-calculix-get-adapter.html)
3. [Configure and run simulations](adapter-calculix-config.html)
4. Follow a tutorial:
   * [Tutorial for CHT with OpenFOAM and CalculiX](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Tutorial-for-CHT-with-OpenFOAM-and-CalculiX): Flow in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger
   * [Tutorial for FSI with OpenFOAM and CalculiX](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Tutorial-for-FSI-with-OpenFOAM-and-CalculiX): Flow in a channel with an elastic flap, either perpendicular, or parallel to the flow and attached to a cylinder.
   * [Tutorial on structure-structure coupling](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Tutorial-for-SSI-with-CalculiX): Elastic beam artificially cut into two halves.

## Versions

Please check the [Calculix adapter README](https://github.com/precice/calculix-adapter/blob/master/README.md) for the newest compatible CalculiX version.

Adapters for older versions of CalculiX and preCICE are available in various branches. Branches compatible with **preCICE v2.x:**

* master
* v2.15_preCICE2.x

All other branches are compatible with **preCICE v1.x**.

## History

The adapter was initially developed for conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations via preCICE by Lucia Cheung in the scope of her master’s thesis [[1]](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). For running the adapter for CHT simulations refer to this thesis. The adapter was extended to fluid-structure interaction by Alexander Rusch [[2]](https://www.gacm2017.uni-stuttgart.de/registration/Upload/ExtendedAbstracts/ExtendedAbstract_0138.pdf).
