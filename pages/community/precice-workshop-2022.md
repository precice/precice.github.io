The 3rd preCICE Workshop will be held virtually through [SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), on February 21-24, 2022. The workshop is a coming together of the preCICE community to share ideas, experiences and knowledge about using preCICE, and to learn from others in the process.

[Registration](https://precice.org/precice-workshop-2022.html#registration) is now open. We look forward to welcoming back previous participants, and introducing more members to the preCICE community.

Due to the uncertain times we are experiencing with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the great success of the virtual workshop in February 2021, we are planning to host the workshop virtually again.

If you have any questions regarding the workshop, please contact us at [`precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de`](mailto:precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de).

## Registration

This is an academic, non-profit conference. However, we still have to collect a small registration fee.
For early registrations (until January 17), the registration fee is

* 50€ for members of universities and public research institutes and
* 150€ for all other participants.

Registration is still possible after this date, with a registration fee of

* 100€ for members of universities and public research institutes and
* 300€ for all other participants.

Please use the [registration form](https://tagung.informatik-forum.org/preCICE2022/register) to register.

For those who do not have funding to pay for the registration, you can write an email to us at [`precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de`](mailto:precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de), and we will evaluate each case individually. For selected cases we will supply a voucher to be used when registering that voids the required payment.

## Call for contributions

Please note that this is not a classical scientific conference, but a user and developer meeting. Contributions are very welcome, if they fit the purpose, but not mandatory. We ask for contributions are in the form of pre-recorded talks.

Possible contributions include (non-exclusively):

* New adapters for community codes
* Coupling numerics
* Comparison of different mapping, coupling, and communication methods
* Coupling boundary conditions
* Multi-scale coupling
* Building, packaging, testing, documentation and other Research Software Engineering topics

If you would like to submit a talk, please fill in the respective details during the registration process. We encourage all speakers to pre-record their talk (similar to the talks from [our last workshop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2obW2udWdoxe1TGVuJXyIRM2JA8pOEL)) and submit them a few days before the workshop starts, since pre-recorded talks have worked out well in the past. However, for special cases a live presentation is still possible. If you want to give a live presentation, please write to us at [`precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de`](mailto:precice2022@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de) so that we can work with you for the planning of your talk. Have a look at the [important dates](https://precice.org/precice-workshop-2022.html#important-dates) below for relevant deadlines.
