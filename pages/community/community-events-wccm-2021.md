The [ECCOMAS WCCM 2020](https://www.wccm-eccomas2020.org/frontal/introduction.asp) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201203110253/https://www.wccm-eccomas2020.org/frontal/MSList.asp)) was originally scheduled for summer 2020 in Paris, but was moved to January 11-15, 2021 in a virtual format. Continuing the tradition, we organized a minisymposium (MS202) "[Multiphysics simulations with the coupling library preCICE](https://www.wccm-eccomas2020.org/admin/Files/FileAbstract/a202.pdf)".

## The minisymposium

Thanks to the WCCM organizers, authors were given access to their recorded talks to be shared with the public. The links of the titles below lead to the recordings on SlideLive.

{% note %}
If you gave a talk at the minisymposium, please contact us and we will include it in the list!

You can find all the abstracts in the [book of WCCM abstracts](https://www.wccm-eccomas2020.org/frontal/docs/WCCM-XIV-ECCOMAS-2020.pdf).

Our (rather small) minisymposium was not included in the live sessions, but we organized our own live session, which was a nice chance to discuss with the speakers. Read more and comment in [the forum](https://precice.discourse.group/t/precice-minisymposium-at-eccomas-wccm-2020-this-week/416).

## Further talks about preCICE

Large conferences like this are an ideal opportunity to discuss with other groups and change our perspective. For this reason, we also participated with talks in different sessions:

- 2215 - [Quasi-Newton Waveform Iteration for Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction](https://slideslive.com/38945082) by Benjamin Uekermann
- 2197 - Quasi-Newton Waveform Iteration for Solving Coupled Problems in a Partitioned Fashion by Benjamin Rodenberg
