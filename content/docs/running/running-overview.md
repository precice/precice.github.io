You got your solvers installed and your case configured?
It's finally time to run your simulation.

Here you will find additional resources on how to:

- run the [simulation on your machine](running-simple.html).
- understand the [output files generated by preCICE](running-output-files).
- setup the simulation on a [distributed cluster](running-distributed).
- create [jobfiles for SLURM](running-slurm).
