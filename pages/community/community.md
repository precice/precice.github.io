## preCICE workshops

Do you want to meet the community and learn what is new in preCICE? There is no better way than to join one of our workshops! We already had preCICE workshops in [February 2020](precice-workshop-2020.html) (Munich), [February 2021](precice-workshop-2021.html) (online/Stuttgart), and [February 2022](precice-workshop-2022.html) (online/Stuttgart). We are currently organizing our next workshop again in presence, in Munich, in [February 2023](precice-workshop-2023.html). We are excited to continue to interact with all users/developers/interested-persons and enthusiasts of preCICE.

## Support preCICE

There are different ways how to support preCICE and get priority support from the preCICE developers in return. [Find out which options](community-support-precice.html).

## How our community is using preCICE

We have compiled a community showcase with several of the most impressive preCICE implementations. The range of application fields is diverse, including e.g.  simulating the [temperatures on the moon](community-projects.html#simulation-of-temperatures-on-the-moon-with-thermos),  the [biomechanics of the heart valve](community-projects.html#evaluation-of-heart-balve-biomechanics), [modelling wind in urban areas](community-projects.html#hybrid-simulation-methods-for-wind-modelling-in-urban-areas), and simluating [high impact loads on structures](community-projects.html#fsi-simulations-of-high-impact-loads-on-structures).
You can find many more use cases on the [projects page](community-projects.html).
