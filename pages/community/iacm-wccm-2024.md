The [WCCM 2024 / PANACM 2024](https://www.wccm2024.org/) will take place in Vancouver, Canada, between July 21-26.

We are again organizing a preCICE minisymposium: [Multi-Physics and Multi-Scale Simulations with the Coupling Library preCICE](https://storage.googleapis.com/usacm_static_shared/wccm2024/MS_0415.pdf) (0415). Preliminary schedule:

- [Session 1](https://events.rdmobile.com/Sessions/Details/2422120) (TS7, Wed 9:45-11:45):
  - A quick introduction to the coupling library preCICE and the minisymposium (Gerasimos Chourdakis, University of Stuttgart)
  - Micro manager: a tool for multiscale coupling with preCICE (Ishaan Desai, University of Stuttgart)
  - Gismo & WaterLily adapters for the preCICE coupling library (Marin Lauber, Delft University of Technology)
  - Overview of multiphysics coupling efforts at LLNL for advanced energy applications (Jerome Soldberg, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)
- [Session 2](https://events.rdmobile.com/Sessions/Details/2422139) (TS8, Wed 14:00-16:00):
  - Speed up the multi-scale simulations with preCICE and MicroManager: resuts for a porous media flow (Jun Chen, University of Stuttgart)
  - Flexible macro-micro coupling for spatial simulation of the liver (Steffen Gerh√§usser, University of Stuttgart)
  - A coupled two-muscle-one-tendon model of the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (Carme Homs Pons, University of Stuttgart)
  - Assessment of flow-induced stresses in spiral weld pipes with bends (Shahab Ahmadizade, University of Alberta)

Next to the minisymposium, we are also organizing a [full-day training course](https://www.wccm2024.org/W24-08) in the context of the conference and we are contributing a general poster about preCICE and the new [preECO project](https://precice.discourse.group/t/shape-the-future-of-the-precice-ecosystem-the-preeco-project/2019/1).

Other talks mentioning preCICE in their abstract:
