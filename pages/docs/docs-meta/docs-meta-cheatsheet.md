### Resize: 100% width svg

```html
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/docs/couple-your-code-parallel-coupling.svg" alt="Parallel coupling flow" style="width: 100%">
```

Use the class 'img-responsive' and style 'width: 100%'.

### Center

In addition to the last example add class 'center-block', an absolute 'width' and values 'margin: auto;' to the element's style.

```html
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/events/precice2021.svg" alt="preCICE Workshop banner" style="width: 500px; margin: auto;">
```

## Markdown in HTML block

```html
<details markdown="1">
* `regular-prior`: In every `advance` call (also for subcycling) and in ...
</details>
```

## LaTeX Math Syntax

Use two dollar signs \$$ to delimit math syntax:

```md
$$ \sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2 $$
```

$$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$$

In the future we might implement [server-side rendering](https://gendignoux.com/blog/2020/05/23/katex.html).
