Tutorials are meant as starting points to build your own coupled simulations. Our collection has grown rapidly over the past few years and [your contribution is very welcome](community-contribute-to-precice.html)!

{% tip %}
Is this your your first time trying our preCICE? Read first the [Quickstart](quickstart.html) guide or [watch a talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/preCICECoupling/).

You can find all tutorial case files in the [tutorials repository](https://github.com/precice/tutorials). Get the [latest release](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/releases/latest), or clone the Git repository to easily update them in the future:

```bash
git clone --branch=master --depth 1 https://github.com/precice/tutorials.git
```

## Basic cases

We recommend that you start from one of the following cases, which you can quickly run on your laptop:

- [Flow over a heated plate](tutorials-flow-over-heated-plate.html): A **conjugate heat transfer** scenario. Try OpenFOAM, FEniCS, or Nutils.
- [Partitioned heat conduction](tutorials-partitioned-heat-conduction.html): The mathematician's dream: split the **heat equation** in two and glue it again. Pick your Dirichlet and Neumann solvers among FEniCS, Nutils, and OpenFOAM.
- Flow in a channel with an elastic [perpendicular flap](tutorials-perpendicular-flap.html): A **fluid-structure interaction** scenario. Feel free to combine different solvers, among OpenFOAM, SU2, deal.II, FEniCS, Nutils, CalculiX, and DUNE.

## All cases

In the following cases, you can explore different aspects of preCICE:

- [ASTE turbine](tutorials-aste-turbine.html): An example case for ASTE to investigate different preCICE mappings using a turbine geometry.

## Community projects

Apart from these simple tutorial cases, the community has tried preCICE in different setups. Check out our new [community projects](https://precice.discourse.group/c/community-projects/11) section in our forum, or read the [community stories](community-projects.html).

## General hints

You can start any tutorial by opening multiple terminals, navigating to each participant case, and running `./run.sh`. To make the "multiple terminals" part easier, it is often convenient to use a terminal multiplexer, such as [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) or [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

Before running a case again, cleanup previous results with the included cleaning scripts.

Are you wondering how to visualize the various results generated? Have a look in our [visualization hints](tutorials-visualization.html).
